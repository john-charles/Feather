# Feather.js bringing sanity to `contentEditable`

Feather is designed to be fast lightweight and extensible and is modeled loosely after the guardian scribe project.

# Why Feather
- Fast, small and light weight.
- Always remembers it's selections even if other inputs are focused.
- Light extensable api, capable of creating and using custom commands.
- Sane HTML eventually.
